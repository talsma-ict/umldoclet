/**
 * Package containing the model to generate {@code PlantUML} diagrams with.
 *
 * <p>
 * The UML model abstractions are very similar to the Object Oriented paradigm
 * and the Java syntax; therefore closely resemble the model behind the JavaDoc tool itself.
 * Despite this, it helps to separate the actual Java syntax model (as provided by the Javadoc tool)
 * from the one containing just the necessary UML model.

 * Package containing an internal minimal logging abstraction that can be easily mapped to common logging frameworks
 * (such as {@code java.util.logging} or {@code Slf4J}) but also to the Javadoc {@code Reporter}.
 *
 * <p>
 * All formal logging {@linkplain nl.talsmasoftware.umldoclet.logging.Message messages}
 * are included as enumeration to ensure a resource is provided for each of them.
 * This makes internationalization of the doclet easier and safer.

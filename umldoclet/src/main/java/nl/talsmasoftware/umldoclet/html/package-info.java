/**
 * Package dedicated to the HTML postprocessing required to embed UML diagrams into the documentation.
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is implemented as a standalone {@linkplain nl.talsmasoftware.umldoclet.html.HtmlPostprocessor} that
 * uses the {@code Configuration} to find the locations of both
 * the generated HTML and the generated UML diagrams.<br>
 * Using these locations and knowledge of the naming conventions results in relative paths to
 * the various diagrams from the HTML that documents them.
 * The HTML files are then modified by inserting these relative diagram references.
 *
 * <p>
 * Scalable Vector Graphics ({@code SVG} diagrams) are inserted as {@code <object>} tags,
 * which makes their links clickable from the document.
 * All other images are inserted as normal {@code <img>} tags.
